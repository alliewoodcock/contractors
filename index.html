      <p>It’s important to understand if these contractors are independent or under some other company’s control.  If they have an employer (meaning their visa is held by a third party organization) all negotiations must be done through their employer (we sometimes call them “keepers”).

      <p>Some candidates still have an obligation to their employer, others do not <strong>(note: need to find out what type of EAD they are)</strong>. It could mean they need sponsorship or they could just be waiting for their Green Card</p>

    <h2>Employment Options</h2>

      <li><a href="#1099">1099</a></li>
      <li><a href="#c2c">C2C</a></li>
      <li><a href="#w2">W2</a></li>
    </ul>

    <div id="1099">
      <h2><strong>1099</strong></h2>
      <p> this is used in short-term contracts, we don’t like to go over a 4-month contract utilizing this option.  This type of contract means that the tax obligations are solely the responsibility of the contractor and CultureFit will send them a 1099 form at the end of the calendar year. </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p> In short, if your candidate is making $25/hour, and they work 40-hours in a week, the contractor will get paid through CultureFit a total of $1,000.00/week (of which, no taxes will be taken out).  Having this type of contract is a benefit to CultureFit, because we do not have to pay the costs of carrying another employee.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="c2c">
    <h2><strong>C2C | Corp-to-Corp</strong></h2>
    <p>The candidate is incorporated meaning the candidate has his/her own company.  The H1 candidates are W2 employees and we are sub-contracting their services corporation to corporation.  Besides H1 candidates, many contractors incorporate themselves and get paid C2C (these candidates can be Green Card or US Citizens).</p>  
    
    <p>This situation is very beneficial to CultureFit.  It can be long-term, and we do not have to pay the cost of carrying another employee. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="w2">
    <h2><strong>W2</strong></h2>
    <p> When hiring these contractors, we take on the costs of having another employee.  These are not as financially beneficial and should only be used when absolutely needed and in cases of longer contracts when the contractor is not incorporated.</p>  
    <p>We are at risk for having to pay unemployment if they are fired, benefits, etc. </p>
    <p><strong>Rates need to be adjusted in order to carry the cost of these types of contractors.  W2 employees have to fill out a Federal W-4, IL W-4, 1-9, and a W2 employee contract agreement</strong></p>

  <div id="goals">
  <h2> Our Goals</h2>
 
  <ol>
    <li>Matching the best candidates with our Client's Roles.</li>
    <li>Making Money.</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
      <li style="margin-left:2em">Differences in profit margin has a huge impact on commission payouts to employees and the overall profitability of CultureFit.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Examples of Profitability:</h3>

  <div id="ex1">
    
    <h3>$25/hr</h3>
    <p>CultureFit’s profit margin on a contract employee is $25/hour, the contractor works 40 hours per week for a 6 month contract.</p>
    <p>Total Profit: $26,000.00</p>
    <h3><strong>Your Potential Commission:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tier 1: $1,300.00</li>
      <li>Tier 4: $4,420.00</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="ex2">
    <h3>$35/hr</h3>
    <p>CultureFit’s profit margin on a contract employee is $35/hour, the contractor works 40 hours per week for a 6 month contract.</p>
    <p>Total Profit: $36,400.00</p>
    <h3><strong>Your Potential Commission:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tier 1: $1,820.00</li>
      <li>Tier 4: $6,188.00</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div id="w2s">
    <h2>W2 Contractors</h2>
    <p>Contractor identification is key.  W2 employees cost CultureFit money.  That cost must be made up in their hourly rate.</p>
    <p><strong>As a rule of thumb, the cost is an additional 20% to CultureFit.  If the candidate wants health benefits, it's an an additional 30% to CultureFit!</strong></p>
